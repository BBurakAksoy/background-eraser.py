# Image Background Removal

This script removes the background from an image using the `rembg` library.

## Installation

Before running the script, you'll need to install the `rembg` library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install rembg

Save the script to a file, for example remove_background.py.
Run the script with the name of the image whose background you want to delete:
python remove_background.py

The script will create an output image called output.png with the background removed.
